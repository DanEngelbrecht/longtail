          Changes in this Release
          - *API CHANGED*: `Longtail_BlockStoreAPI` now expects a `RetargetContent` function
          - *API CHANGED*: `Longtail_CreateBikeshedJobAPI` now takes second parameter with priority of worker tasks
            - *API ADDED*: `Longtail_GetMissingContent`
          - Now possible to write/change version without downloading full index from BlockStore
          - `Longtail_CacheBlockStore` now returns merged content index from local and remote index
          - Cleaned up blockstore constructors
          - longtail cmd tool now does downsync without fetching full index from blockstore
          - `LongtailBlockStore::PreflightGet`: Cache block store filters out blocks it knows before passing to remote store
          - Added semaphore wait with timout to avoid calls to Longtail_Sleep()
