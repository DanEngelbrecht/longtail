          # Changes in this Release
          - **CHANGED API** `Longtail_StorageAPI` now has `MapFile` and `UnMapFile` to do memory mapping of files when reading, return ENOTSUP in implementation to enable regular I/O fallback
          - **CHANGED** Archive block store now uses memory mapped file if possible when reading blocks from archive file (perf improvement)
          - **FIX** Sort of write jobs for assets spanning multiple blocks to increase hit rate in LRU (perf improvement)
          - **FIX** Remove redundant check if directory exists when getting directory name (perf improvement)
          - **FIX** Use SOA for asset part lookup (minor perf improvement)
          - **FIX** Don't set permissions on files that already have correct permissions (minor perf improvement)
          - **FIX** Faster EnsureParentPathExists (minor perf improvement)
          - **UPDATE** zstdlib updated to 1.5.2
